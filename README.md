Factory
=======

Maybe is another clone of BSD Ports system. This has started as a simple script to install some software from package and grow naturally. I have decided to release under GPLv2 just in case it helps someone else.

It was made to scratch my own itch therefore do not expect much from it.

Isn't user friendly or user proof therefore be warned, maybe in a near future I will write something easily usable.

To install just run:

  ./install.sh

And follow the instructions after installation procedure.

If you wish to change anything, take a look on factory.config, but do it before run install.sh.


Cheers!
